"""Gymnasium environment that uses the *real* rotary inverted pendulum
as its dynamics model.

This is the Phase 4 "sim-to-real fine-tuning" environment: SAC's
`learn()` collects (s, a, r, s') transitions by physically driving the
device, instead of stepping MuJoCo. The policy thus adapts to the
actual hardware dynamics, closing the residual sim-to-real gap that
pure sim training can't.

Observation, action, and reward exactly mirror `pendulum_env.py` so
that a sim-trained checkpoint loads without modification.

Reset behaviour:
    - Disengage the motor.
    - Wait `reset_settle_s` seconds for the pendulum to stop swinging
      under bearing friction.
    - Re-engage the motor at its current position. The motor stays where
      the previous episode ended (no homing) — this matches the typical
      Furuta sim-to-real fine-tuning recipe and avoids unnecessary motor
      wear.

Termination/Truncation:
    - Truncated when `episode_length_s` elapses.
    - Terminated (with `hard_stop_penalty`) if the un-flipped motor
      position |motor_pos| exceeds MOTOR_LIMIT_RAD (the firmware also
      enforces this in hardware, so the policy should never command
      past it; the check here is the policy's "feedback" if it does).

Safety:
    - SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers disengage the motor and close the serial
      port cleanly.
    - Failures during `step()` (lost serial, etc.) raise immediately;
      the SAC training loop will surface them.
