"""Single source of truth for the RL reward function.

Both `pendulum_env.py` (sim training) and `real_env.py` (rig fine-tuning)
call into `compute_reward()` so that the gradient signal during fine-tune
matches the basin SAC found in sim. The previous duplicated `_reward`
implementations drifted on 2026-05-21 (sim env got the stillness bonus,
real env didn't) and silently undid every fine-tune attempt because SAC's
real-rig gradient pushed the policy out of the bonus basin back toward
whatever the simpler canonical reward preferred. Don't repeat that
mistake — keep this function as the only place the reward math lives.
