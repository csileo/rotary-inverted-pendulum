"""Gymnasium environment for the rotary inverted pendulum, parameterised
from the system-identification fits in sysid_params.json.

Geometry (Furuta pendulum):
    - Arm rotates about a vertical axis, driven by a position-controlled
      "motor" (modelling the AccelStepper + driver as a stiff PD).
    - Pendulum hinges at the end of the arm, free-swinging in the vertical
      plane perpendicular to the arm direction. Hangs straight down at rest.

Observation (5-dim):
    [motor_pos, sin(theta), cos(theta), motor_vel, pendulum_vel]
    where theta = 0 is upright (so cos(theta) = 1 at the goal).

Action (1-dim, in [-1, 1]):
    Maps to a position-delta added to the motor's commanded target each
    control step.

Reward:
    upright term      = (1 + cos(theta)) / 2     in [0, 1]
    motor-pos penalty = -k_pos * (motor_pos / motor_limit)^2
    motor-vel penalty = -k_vel * motor_vel^2
    action penalty    = -k_act * action^2

    Pendulum inertia decomposition: MJCF expects the inertia tensor in the
    body's *inertial* frame, expressed about the COM. Our pendulum body's
    frame x-axis is aligned with the joint's rotation axis (axis="1 0 0").
    For rotation about the joint axis through the joint origin, the
    parallel-axis theorem gives
        I_about_joint_x = I_com_xx + m * (perpendicular distance from x-axis to COM)^2

    back-computing I_axis − m·d² from sysid: the sysid I_axis is consistent
    with the CAD value to within 5%, and using the CAD constant keeps
    `(m, d, I_com)` independent so DR can sample m and d without dragging
    I_com along with the point-mass approximation. For the off-axis
    components: a rod-like pendulum extending along z has appreciable extent
    perpendicular to y, so iyy ≈ ixx; izz (length-axis) is near zero.
    Slight asymmetry doesn't affect 1-DOF swing dynamics but keeps MuJoCo's
    solver well-conditioned.
