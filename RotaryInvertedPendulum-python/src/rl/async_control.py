"""Asynchronous control architecture for real-device SAC fine-tuning.

Decouples the rig's 100 Hz control loop from SB3's gradient updates so the
configured control rate is the actual control rate, regardless of how slow
the learner is.

Two threads, three small primitives:

  TransitionQueue  — thread-safe FIFO that the control thread writes and
                     the learner thread drains in batches.
  PolicySnapshot   — inference-only deepcopy of the SAC actor that the
                     control thread reads from. The learner refreshes it
                     after every model.train() call. Required because
                     optimizer.step() does in-place .data writes that
                     would otherwise race with concurrent forward passes.
  AsyncControlLoop — the 100 Hz control thread itself. Reads state,
                     predicts via the snapshot, commands the motor, posts
                     transitions to the queue. Externally paced; never
                     blocks on the learner.

The orchestrator (finetune_async.py) owns the threads, the SAC model,
and the replay buffer. See docs/rl_transitions.md for the full
architectural rationale.
